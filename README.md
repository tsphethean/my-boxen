# Our Boxen

This is a template Boxen project designed for your organization to fork and
modify appropriately.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository.
2. Modify the `Puppetfile` and `modules/` to your heart's content.
3. Get a copy of your fork somewhere locally.
4. Install the XCode Command Line Tools package. You need an Apple ID. We know. It sucks. You can thank Apple for not allowing the Command Line Tools to be redistributed publicly.
5. `cd` to that dir and run `script/boxen`
6. Rock out. :metal:
